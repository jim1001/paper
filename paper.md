# Introduction
We present aircraft measurements of BBOA over West Africa.
Particle size was measured using a PCASP (Bloggs et al 2004).
Jones et al (1998)) conducted several studies in this region, 
but continental scale measurements have not previously been made.

# Motivation
Find out more about this important phenomenon.

# Simulations
We simulate the evolution of particle sizes as they are transported 
away from the source region

# Methodology
We compared our measurements of particle aging with a 
model simulation. The model is details in Smith et al 
(2002).

# Results 
The simulations indicate that coagulation is the
dominant growth mechanism for these particles.

# Conclusions
We have made fantastic insight into the BBOA aging process.
Nonetheless questions remain unanswered, so more
funding is required.
